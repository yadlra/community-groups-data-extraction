- social data science research in Mexico -> mining data

## Thoughts

An essential part of how I see my involvement in research and the use of tech is this constant reflection of the 'extractive' and many times 'exclusionary' methods and tools to carry out quantitative research. 
Being aware of terms like 'extacting data' and/or 'mining data' allows me as a researcher to not fall within a mentality of extraction and objectifying the humans whose data I am working with. Or so I'd love to think!
