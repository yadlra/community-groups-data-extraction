- social data science research in Mexico -> mining data

## Thoughts

An essential part of how I see my involvement in research and the use of tech is this constant reflection of the 'extractive' and many times 'exclusionary' methods and tools to carry out quantitative research. 

A term I am  deeply committed to in the AI ethics research is the 'decolonization of AI'. So, being aware of terms like 'extacting data' and/or 'mining data' allows me as a researcher to not fall within a mentality of extraction and objectifying the humans whose data I am working with. Or so I'd like to think!
